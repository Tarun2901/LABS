In a hyperbola centered at (0,0),
symmetric about the X and Y-axes, defined by the
equation
x^2 / a^2 - y^2 / b^2 = 1
We consider here only the case a>b in which the
hyperbola has 2 regions, one in which the major
axis of movement is Y (Region 1) and another in
which the major axis of movement is X (Region 2).
If a < =b there is no Region 2. The two regions
are separated by the point where the tangent to the
hyperbola has slope dy/dx = 1.
In Region 1 , the expressions for a
measure of the distance of the true hyperbola to the
2 nearest pixels are:
d1 = b^2 * x^2 - b^2* x^2i
b2 = b^2 (xi + 1)^2 - b^2 * x^2

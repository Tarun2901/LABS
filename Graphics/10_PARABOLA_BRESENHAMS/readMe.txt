In a parabola centered at (0,0) symmetric
about the X-axis defined by the equation
y^2 = 2px
In Region 1 the axis of major movement is Y
while in Region 2 it is X. The two regions meet at
x = p/2, y = p where the tangent to the parabola
has slope dy/dx = 1.
In Region 1 the expressions for a measure of the
distance of the true parabola to the 2 nearest pixels
are:
d1 =  px - pxi
d2 = p(xi + 1) - px

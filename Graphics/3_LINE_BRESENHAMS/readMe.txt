Draw a line using Bresenham's approach.


In this approach the next pixel to be selected is done only through integer addition and subtraction with no floating point arithmetic calcuation.

A decision parameter is defined which indicates the next pixel to be selected based on the previous pixel and differential equation. The selction is made on the basis of which pixel is more closer to the actual curve.
